**Lisa:** Hi everyone, thanks for joining. Robert, Amy, Tom—good to see you all together.

**Robert:** Thanks for setting this up. We're excited to see what you've got.

**Lisa:** Great. Quick agenda: Alex is going to walk through TribeAI, but we've customized this demo specifically for SalesForce360. We're using one of your actual opportunities—the DataCorp deal Amy mentioned. Sound good?

**Amy:** Perfect, that's a good one to use.

**Lisa:** Alex, all yours.

**Alex:** Thanks Lisa. So let me show you what TribeAI looks like for a rep. This is the daily dashboard. What you're seeing here are the 12 active deals assigned to this rep, automatically prioritized by what needs attention today.

**Alex:** See this one at the top? It's the DataCorp deal. TribeAI flagged it as "Needs immediate attention" because the champion, Sarah Kim, hasn't responded to the last two emails over 8 days. That's unusual based on her previous engagement pattern.

**Amy:** Wait, how does it know that's unusual?

**Alex:** It's tracking engagement velocity for every contact. Sarah was responding within 24 hours for 3 weeks, then suddenly nothing. Pattern break equals red flag.

**Robert:** That's actually super helpful. Our reps don't catch that until it's too late.

**Alex:** Exactly. And look what it's suggesting: "Consider multi-threading—engage Sarah's manager Mike Park. He attended the demo but hasn't received direct follow-up." It even drafted an email template based on similar successful deals.

**Tom:** It wrote the email?

**Alex:** It drafted it. Rep can edit before sending. Let me show you what it generated. *Opens draft email* See? It's referencing the demo Mike attended, mentions a specific feature he asked about, and suggests a quick call. Not generic at all.

**Amy:** That's impressive. How does it know Mike asked about that feature?

**Alex:** It analyzes meeting notes and recordings. When Mike said "I'm really interested in the forecasting piece" in the demo, TribeAI noted that and surfaced it when it made sense to follow up.

**Lisa:** And this is all automatic? The rep doesn't have to manually tag that?

**Alex:** Completely automatic. The rep just does their job—calls, emails, meetings—and TribeAI processes everything in the background.

**Robert:** Show me the deal scoring. How does that work?

**Alex:** Good question. *Navigates to deal score breakdown* TribeAI scores every deal on a 0-100 scale across multiple dimensions. Let's look at DataCorp again. Overall score: 68. That's moderate risk.

**Alex:** Here's the breakdown:
- Engagement: 55 (red flag—that's the champion ghosting situation)
- Stakeholder coverage: 72 (yellow—we've talked to 3 of 5 key stakeholders)
- Competitive threat: 80 (green—no competitor signals detected)
- Timeline alignment: 65 (yellow—their budget cycle ends in 6 weeks, deal is moving slower than optimal)

**Tom:** This is gold. We try to do this manually in deal reviews, but we don't have the data to back it up like this.

**Amy:** What happens if we fix that engagement issue? Would the score go up?

**Alex:** Let's find out. *Simulates sending the follow-up email to Mike Park* In practice, once the rep sends this and Mike responds, the engagement score would update. But let me show you a deal where everything's healthy.

**Alex:** *Navigates to different deal* This is the TechFlow opportunity. Score: 87. Look at the difference:
- All stakeholders engaged regularly
- Strong buying signals (pricing discussion initiated by them)
- No competitive threats
- Timeline aligned with their fiscal year end

**Robert:** How often do high-scored deals actually close?

**Alex:** Deals scoring 80+ close at about 75% rate. Deals under 60? About 25%. That's across all our customers, but you'd see your own benchmarks once we train on your data.

**Amy:** So we'd know which deals to actually focus on versus which ones are wishful thinking.

**Alex:** Exactly. Let me show you one more thing—the manager view. *Switches to manager dashboard* Robert, this would be yours. You can see all deals across all reps, filtered by any criteria.

**Robert:** *leans in* Okay, this is what I need.

**Alex:** See these pipeline trends? You can spot patterns. Like here—*points to chart*—deals with 4+ stakeholders engaged close 45% faster than deals with only 1-2. That's the kind of insight you can use to coach your team.

**Tom:** Can we drill into individual rep performance?

**Alex:** Absolutely. *Navigates to rep scorecard* This shows you each rep's deal velocity, engagement metrics, win rates, areas where they're strong and where they need help.

**Amy:** This is better than the manual scorecards I'm creating in spreadsheets every month.

**Lisa:** And it updates in real-time, not once a month.

**Robert:** Okay, I'm sold on the value. What's it take to get this running?

**Alex:** Two weeks. Week one, we integrate with your Salesforce, HubSpot, email, whatever systems you're using. We sync your historical deal data—last 12-18 months ideally—so the AI can learn your patterns.

**Alex:** Week two, we train your team. Usually a 1-hour session for reps, a separate session for managers. Then we run a pilot with 5-10 reps to make sure everything's working smoothly before full rollout.

**Tom:** What about data security? We have some big enterprise clients who are particular about that.

**Alex:** SOC 2 Type II certified. Your data stays in your environment, encrypted at rest and in transit. We never train our models on your proprietary data. I can send you our security white paper.

**Tom:** Please do.

**Robert:** What's the investment look like for a team our size?

**Lisa:** For 45 reps, you're looking at about $12,000 per month, which includes everything—platform, implementation, support, quarterly business reviews where we optimize based on your results.

**Robert:** So $144K annually.

**Lisa:** Right. And we typically see ROI within 90 days. If you get even 15-20% improvement in deal velocity, that's millions in additional revenue for a team your size.

**Amy:** What would a pilot look like?

**Lisa:** Good question. We'd propose a 60-day pilot with 10 of your reps—maybe 5 from Amy's team, 5 from another manager. We set clear success metrics upfront. After 60 days, we review results and you decide whether to expand to the full team.

**Robert:** What kind of metrics?

**Lisa:** Usually deal cycle time, win rate, rep productivity, pipeline accuracy. We'd customize based on what matters most to you.

**Robert:** Let me talk to Amy and Tom, but I think we're ready to move forward with a pilot. What's the timeline?

**Lisa:** We could start as early as next week if you're ready. I'll send over pilot details, success metrics, and a contract today.

**Robert:** Sounds good. Send that over. Amy, Tom—any other questions?

**Amy:** Just one—can reps access this on mobile?

**Alex:** Yes, full mobile app. Same insights, same functionality.

**Amy:** Perfect.

**Robert:** Alright, send the docs and let's get moving.

**Lisa:** Will do. Thanks everyone—this is going to be great.
