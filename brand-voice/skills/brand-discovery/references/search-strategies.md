# Search Strategies by Platform

Platform-specific query patterns and tips for maximizing brand material discovery.

## Notion (Primary Discovery Engine)

Notion AI Search federates across connected sources (Google Drive, SharePoint, OneDrive, Slack, Jira, Teams), making it the most valuable single search endpoint.

### Query Patterns

**Direct brand searches:**
- "brand guidelines"
- "style guide"
- "brand voice"
- "tone of voice"
- "messaging framework"

**Sales and marketing content:**
- "pitch deck"
- "sales playbook"
- "email templates"
- "value proposition"
- "competitive positioning"

**Operational brand content:**
- "brand update"
- "rebrand"
- "launch messaging"
- "press release template"
- "social media guidelines"

### Tips
- Notion AI Search returns results from connected sources — one search covers multiple platforms
- Search for the company name + "brand" to find company-specific guidelines
- Check for databases titled "Brand Assets", "Marketing Resources", or "Content Library"
- Look for pages tagged with "brand", "marketing", "style"

## Atlassian Confluence

Enterprises often store official brand documentation in Confluence spaces.

### Query Patterns

**Space-level search:**
- Search spaces named: "Marketing", "Brand", "Communications", "Sales Enablement"
- Check for spaces with labels: "brand", "style-guide", "guidelines"

**Page-level search:**
- "brand style guide"
- "voice and tone guidelines"
- "messaging framework"
- "content standards"
- "editorial guidelines"

**Template search:**
- "email template"
- "proposal template"
- "presentation template"

### Tips
- Confluence spaces often have hierarchical page trees — find the brand root page and explore children
- Check for recently updated pages (brand guidelines evolve)
- Look for pages with many watchers — indicates important shared content
- Search attachments for PDF brand guides uploaded to Confluence pages

## Google Drive

Cloud file storage — official brand documents, shared decks, and style guides frequently live here.

### Query Patterns

**Folder search:**
- "Brand Guidelines"
- "Marketing Assets"
- "Brand Kit"
- "Style Guide"
- "Sales Collateral"

**Document search:**
- "brand guide" (PDF, DOCX, Google Docs)
- "style guide" (PDF, DOCX, Google Docs)
- "messaging document"
- "brand standards"

### Tips
- Google Drive often contains the "source of truth" brand guides as Google Docs or PDFs
- Check shared drives with company-wide access
- Look for folders shared with the marketing or brand team
- Search for recently modified brand documents to find the latest version

## Gong (Conversation Intelligence)

Sales call transcripts reveal how the brand actually communicates in practice.

### Query Patterns

**Call search:**
- Search for calls tagged: "won", "closed-won" (successful brand application)
- Filter by top performers (their language patterns define implicit brand voice)
- Look for calls tagged: "demo", "discovery", "closing"

**Transcript search:**
- Search transcripts for company-specific value propositions
- Look for recurring phrases across successful calls
- Find calls where competitors are discussed (reveals positioning)

### Tips
- Focus on successful calls — they represent brand voice that works
- Compare top performer language with average performer language
- Look for consistent opening lines and closing patterns
- Note objection handling language — reveals brand positioning under pressure

## Figma (Brand Design Systems)

Visual brand elements inform voice and tone indirectly.

### Query Patterns

**File search:**
- "brand design system"
- "design tokens"
- "brand kit"
- "style guide"
- "component library"

**Component search:**
- Look for files with brand colors, typography scales
- Find component documentation with usage guidelines
- Check for content/copy guidelines in design system docs

### Tips
- Figma design systems often include writing guidelines alongside visual specs
- Check file descriptions and comments for brand context
- Look for "voice and tone" sections within design system documentation
- Brand personality descriptions in design files reveal voice attributes

## Cross-Platform Search Tips

### Maximizing Coverage
1. Start with Notion AI Search (broadest coverage via federation)
2. Follow up with Confluence for enterprise documentation
3. Check Google Drive for official brand documents
4. Search Gong for conversational brand patterns
5. Review Figma for design-embedded brand guidelines

### Avoiding Duplicates
- Track source URLs to detect the same document across platforms
- When the same content appears on multiple platforms, prefer the most recently updated version
- Note when Notion federation returns results from other platforms to avoid double-searching

### Handling No Results
- If a platform returns zero results, try broader queries ("marketing", "sales")
- Check if the platform is actually connected and authenticated
- Note the gap in the discovery report — the absence of content on a platform is itself useful information
