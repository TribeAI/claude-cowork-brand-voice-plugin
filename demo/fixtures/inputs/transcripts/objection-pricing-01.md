**Kevin:** Nicole, thanks for the follow-up. I talked to my team about TribeAI. Everyone's excited about the platform, but I've got to be honest—the price is higher than what we budgeted for.

**Nicole:** I appreciate you being direct, Kevin. Can I ask what you had budgeted?

**Kevin:** We were thinking more like $50-60K annually. Your quote came in at $110K.

**Nicole:** Got it. Let me make sure I understand the gap. What were you planning to get for that $50-60K?

**Kevin:** Honestly, we were looking at a CRM add-on that does basic lead scoring. Nothing as sophisticated as what you showed.

**Nicole:** Okay, so it's not really apples to apples then. Can I walk you through how we think about the investment?

**Kevin:** Sure.

**Nicole:** You've got 32 reps right now, averaging about $850K in revenue per rep annually. Is that about right?

**Kevin:** Yeah, roughly.

**Nicole:** So that's $27 million in total revenue. Now, you mentioned your deal cycles are running 70-80 days and you'd like to get that back down to 50 days. Right?

**Kevin:** That's the goal.

**Nicole:** Okay, let's be conservative. Say TribeAI only gets you halfway there—instead of 70 days, you get to 60 days. That's 14% faster. Same reps, same effort, 14% more deals closed in a year.

**Kevin:** Okay, I'm following.

**Nicole:** Fourteen percent of $27 million is about $3.8 million in additional revenue. And that's assuming no improvement in win rate, no productivity gains, nothing else. Just faster cycles.

**Kevin:** But we'd need to hit that number to justify the cost.

**Nicole:** Actually, you'd only need to hit about 3% improvement to break even on the investment. Anything above that is profit. And our average customer sees 20-30% improvement in their first year.

**Kevin:** What if it doesn't work for us?

**Nicole:** That's fair. Here's what I'd propose: let's do a 90-day pilot with 10 of your reps. We'll measure exactly what impact we're having—deal cycle time, win rates, productivity. After 90 days, if you're not seeing at least 10% improvement in deal velocity, we'll part ways. No hard feelings.

**Kevin:** So I'm only committing to 90 days?

**Nicole:** For the pilot, yes. And we'll structure the pricing so the pilot is $25K. If you love the results and expand to the full team, that $25K gets credited toward the annual contract.

**Kevin:** That's more reasonable. What happens in the pilot?

**Nicole:** We'd pick 10 reps—ideally a mix of your top performers and mid-tier reps. Full implementation just for them. After 90 days, we compare their metrics to a control group of 10 reps not using TribeAI. Data decides.

**Kevin:** I like that. Let's do it. Send me the pilot proposal.

**Nicole:** Will do. I'll get that over to you today.
