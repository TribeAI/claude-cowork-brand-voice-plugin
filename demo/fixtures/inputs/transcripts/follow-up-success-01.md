**Rachel:** Hey Chris, how are you?

**Chris:** Good, Rachel. Thanks for following up.

**Rachel:** Of course. I know you and your team have been evaluating a few options. Where are you in the process?

**Chris:** So we've narrowed it down to TribeAI and one other vendor. Honestly, both products are solid.

**Rachel:** That's good to hear. What's going to help you make the final decision?

**Chris:** I think it comes down to implementation and support. Our last software rollout was a disaster—took 6 months and our team hated it.

**Rachel:** That's painful. What made it so rough?

**Chris:** The vendor basically handed us the software and said "figure it out." We had to build all the workflows ourselves, training was generic videos, and when we had questions, support took days to respond.

**Rachel:** Okay, so implementation experience and ongoing support are make-or-break for you.

**Chris:** Exactly.

**Rachel:** Let me tell you specifically how we'd handle DataPro's implementation, because it's really different from what you described.

**Rachel:** Week one: My implementation team—two people, dedicated full-time to your rollout—will do all the integration work. You don't build anything. We build it based on your workflows.

**Rachel:** Week two: We train your team in small groups. Not generic videos—live sessions customized to how DataPro actually works. Your sales ops person gets a different session than your reps.

**Rachel:** After you're live: You get a dedicated customer success manager. That's me, not a rotation of support people. You have my cell phone. If something breaks, you text me.

**Chris:** That's a very different experience.

**Rachel:** It is. And here's why we do it that way—we know that the product only works if your team actually uses it. If implementation sucks, adoption fails, and then everyone loses. So we're super hands-on in the first 90 days.

**Chris:** What happens after 90 days?

**Rachel:** We don't disappear. We do quarterly business reviews where we look at your metrics, figure out what's working and what's not, and optimize. Think of it as ongoing partnership, not a one-time purchase.

**Chris:** And this is included in the pricing we discussed?

**Rachel:** Yep, all included. No extra fees for implementation, training, or support.

**Chris:** Okay, that addresses my concern. The other vendor quoted us lower, but implementation is extra and support is tiered.

**Rachel:** So when you factor that in, what's the real comparison?

**Chris:** Probably pretty close, actually. Maybe even more expensive to go with them.

**Rachel:** And if implementation takes 6 months instead of 2 weeks, there's an opportunity cost there too.

**Chris:** True. Alright, I'm ready to move forward. What's next?

**Rachel:** I'll send over the contract today. It's pretty straightforward—12-month term, $132K annually, includes everything we discussed. Once you sign, we kick off implementation within 48 hours.

**Chris:** Sounds good. Send it over.

**Rachel:** Will do. One last question—who else needs to approve this on your end?

**Chris:** Just my VP. But I've kept her in the loop. She's good with it.

**Rachel:** Perfect. I'll send the contract in the next hour.
