## Cold Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Growth-Stage Company

**Subject:** Quick thought on [Company]'s growth

```
Hi [Name],

Saw [Company] just raised Series B and is hiring aggressively. Congrats.

Quick question: How are you maintaining deal velocity while scaling your team?

Most companies at your stage see deal cycles slow by 30-40% during rapid hiring.
New reps take 4-6 months to ramp, and deals start slipping.

We help growth-stage teams maintain (and improve) deal velocity during scaling.
[Similar Company] kept their cycle at 32 days while doubling from 20 to 40 reps.

Worth a quick call? I can show you the playbook.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Length:** ~75 words
**Key Elements:** Congratulation, specific challenge, proof point, low-friction CTA

### Template 2: Enterprise Target

**Subject:** [Mutual Connection] suggested we connect

```
Hi [Name],

[Mutual Connection] mentioned you're evaluating AI tools for your sales org.

One thing we're hearing from enterprise teams: most AI sales tools are built for
startups and break at scale. Integration becomes a nightmare.

We built TribeAI specifically for enterprise complexity. Currently working with
[Competitor/Similar Company] to handle 200+ reps across 4 regions.

Happy to share what we learned from their rollout—whether or not TribeAI is
the right fit for [Company].

## Follow-Up Templates

### Template 3: After Initial Call

**Subject:** Next steps for [Company]

```
Hi [Name],

Great talking through [Company]'s sales process today.

Quick recap of what we discussed:
- Current challenge: Deal cycles stretching from 45 to 65 days
- Goal: Get back to 45-day cycles while maintaining quality
- Timeline: Would like to see impact by Q3

Based on our conversation, here's what I'd suggest:

**Next Step:** 30-minute custom demo showing how we'd tackle your specific
deal cycle challenge. I'll walk through the exact workflow using a deal from
your pipeline.

Does [Date/Time Option 1] or [Date/Time Option 2] work?

I'll prepare the demo around the [Specific Deal Type] deals you mentioned.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Tone:** Organized, recap-focused, clear next step
**Length:** ~115 words
**Key Elements:** Recap, specific challenge, custom demo offer, specific options

### Template 4: After Demo/No Response

**Subject:** Thoughts on what we showed?

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on the demo from last week.

I know you're evaluating a few options. Happy to answer any questions that
came up internally—or point you to resources if you want to explore on your own.

A few things I can share based on your use case:
- [Similar Company] case study (45-day to 28-day cycles)
- Technical integration details for [Their CRM]
- Custom ROI model for a [Team Size]-person team

What would be most helpful?

Best,
[Name]

## Closing/Negotiation Templates

### Template 5: Addressing Pricing Concerns

**Subject:** Re: TribeAI pricing

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for being direct about the investment concern.

Let me break down what we're seeing with teams your size:

**Current State (your numbers):**
- 30 reps averaging 6 deals/year = 180 deals
- Average deal: $85K
- Current revenue: $15.3M

**With TribeAI (conservative 25% improvement):**
- Same 30 reps closing 7.5 deals/year = 225 deals
- Additional 45 deals = $3.8M additional revenue
- TribeAI investment: $120K

Even at 50% of expected impact, ROI is 10:1 in year one.

The question isn't whether it pays for itself—it's whether now is the right
time to accelerate.

Want to walk through a custom ROI model for [Company]?

Best,
[Name]
```

**Tone:** Confident, data-driven, consultative
**Length:** ~130 words
**Key Elements:** ROI framework, specific math, de-risks decision

### Template 6: Creating Urgency

**Subject:** Q2 start timeline

```
Hi [Name],

Quick heads-up: If we want TribeAI live for your team by start of Q2, we'd
need to kick off implementation by March 15th.

Here's why the timing matters:

**March 15 start:**
- Week 1-2: Integration and setup
- Week 3: Pilot with core team
- Week 4: Full rollout
- April 1: Full team productive for Q2

**Later start:**
- Q2 ramping instead of producing
- Miss Q2 target impact
- Push value to Q3

Not trying to rush you—just want you to have the full picture on timing.

Where are we in the evaluation?

Best,
[Name]
```

**Tone:** Helpful urgency, timeline-focused, logical
**Length:** ~100 words
**Key Elements:** Clear deadline, logical reasoning, outcome-focused
