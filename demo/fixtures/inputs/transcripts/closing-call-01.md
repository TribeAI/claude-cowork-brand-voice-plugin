**Maria:** James, Susan—thanks for getting on the call together.

**James:** Of course. We wanted to have Susan on since she'll need to approve the investment.

**Maria:** That makes sense. Susan, James has been walking you through TribeAI?

**Susan:** He has. I've reviewed the proposal and the ROI projections. I have a few questions.

**Maria:** Fire away.

**Susan:** Your proposal shows $180K annually. That's not a small investment for a company our size. How confident are you in the ROI numbers you're projecting?

**Maria:** It's a fair question. The projections I shared are based on a 25% improvement in deal cycle time and a 15% improvement in win rate. Those are actually conservative compared to what we typically see, which is 30-40% and 20-25% respectively.

**Susan:** But every company is different. What if we don't hit those numbers?

**Maria:** Here's how I'd think about it: even if you hit half of what we're projecting—so 12% improvement in cycle time and 7% in win rate—you'd still see about $2.2 million in additional revenue in year one. That's a 12x return on the investment.

**Susan:** And if we don't see that?

**Maria:** We include a 90-day performance guarantee. If after 90 days you're not seeing meaningful improvement, we'll refund your money and part ways. No hard feelings.

**Susan:** Okay. What's the payment structure?

**Maria:** Twelve-month contract, billed quarterly. So $45K per quarter. First payment due upon contract signing, then every 90 days after that.

**Susan:** Can we do monthly?

**Maria:** We typically don't, but let me check with my finance team. Can I get back to you on that by end of day?

**Susan:** That works.

**James:** Susan, the other thing I want to make sure you know—we're already losing about $500K per quarter in deals that should close but don't, based on our pipeline leak analysis. TribeAI fixes that.

**Susan:** I saw that in your analysis. That's actually what convinced me we need to do something.

**James:** Right. So even if TribeAI just plugs half that leak, it pays for itself in quarter one.

**Susan:** True. Maria, one more question—what's the cancellation policy?

**Maria:** It's a 12-month commitment. After that, it's month-to-month. You can cancel with 30 days notice.

**Susan:** And if we want to cancel before 12 months?

**Maria:** There's an early termination fee—essentially the remaining months on the contract. But again, the 90-day guarantee means you'll know pretty quickly if it's working.

**Susan:** Okay. James, I'm comfortable approving this if you are.

**James:** I'm ready. Maria, send the contract.

**Maria:** I'll send it right now. Once you sign, we'll kick off implementation within 48 hours. My team will reach out tomorrow to schedule the kickoff call.

**James:** Perfect.

**Susan:** One last thing—can you confirm there are no additional fees? Implementation, training, all that is included?

**Maria:** Correct. Everything is included. The $180K is all-in.

**Susan:** Good. Send the contract and we'll get it signed today.

**Maria:** Awesome. James, Susan—this is going to be great for ScaleUp. Thanks for trusting us.

**James:** Looking forward to it.
