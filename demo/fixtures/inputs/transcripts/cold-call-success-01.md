**Sarah:** Hi Michael, this is Sarah from TribeAI. Is now still a good time for our quick call?

**Michael:** Yeah, I've got about 10 minutes. What's this about?

**Sarah:** Perfect. I'll be quick. I saw CloudTech just raised Series B and you're hiring pretty aggressively—looks like 8 new sales roles posted?

**Michael:** That's right, we're scaling the team.

**Sarah:** That's actually why I reached out. We work with a lot of growth-stage SaaS companies, and we see the same pattern: teams grow, but deal velocity slows down. New reps take forever to ramp, deals start slipping through the cracks. Sound familiar?

**Michael:** *laughs* Yeah, unfortunately. Our deal cycle used to be about 45 days. Now it's pushing 60, sometimes 65.

**Sarah:** That's exactly what we hear. Here's the thing—it doesn't have to be that way. We built TribeAI specifically to help teams maintain deal velocity during rapid growth. One of our clients, similar stage to you, kept their cycle at 32 days while doubling from 20 to 45 reps.

**Michael:** How'd they do that?

**Sarah:** The short version: AI-powered intelligence that helps reps focus on the right deals, automates the manual work, and gets new reps productive way faster. Instead of 4-5 months to ramp, they're seeing 6-8 weeks.

**Michael:** Interesting. What's the catch? Implementation nightmare? Expensive?

**Sarah:** Fair questions. Implementation is actually 2 weeks—we integrate with your existing stack, train the AI on your deals, and you're live. On cost, teams your size typically invest around $100K annually, but the ROI is pretty clear when you're adding back 15-20 days per deal cycle.

**Michael:** So what are you proposing?

**Sarah:** I'd love to show you specifically how this would work for CloudTech. Take one of your deals that's in flight right now, walk through exactly how TribeAI would help move it faster. 30 minutes, I can come to your office or we can do video.

**Michael:** Let's do video. What's your calendar look like?

**Sarah:** I've got openings Thursday at 2pm or Friday at 10am. Which works better?

**Michael:** Friday at 10 works. Send me the invite.

**Sarah:** Perfect. I'll send that right now. One quick question before we hang up—can you tell me what CRM you're using and roughly how many deals are in your pipeline?

**Michael:** We're on Salesforce. Pipeline is usually around 80-100 active opportunities.

**Sarah:** Got it. I'll prep the demo around Salesforce and that volume. See you Friday at 10.

**Michael:** Sounds good.
