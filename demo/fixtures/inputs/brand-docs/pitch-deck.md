# TribeAI Sales Pitch Deck
**Enterprise Sales Presentation | Q1 2024**

---

## Slide 1: Title
**TribeAI: AI-Powered Sales Intelligence**

Close deals 40% faster with intelligence built for B2B sales teams

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Sales Teams Are Drowning in Manual Work

**The Reality:**
- Reps spend 65% of time on non-selling activities
- Deal cycles stretch 6-12 months in enterprise
- New reps take 4-6 months to ramp up
- Critical insights lost in CRM data overload

**The Cost:**
$2M+ in lost revenue per year for a 50-person sales team

---

## Slide 3: Why Now?

### The Old Approach Isn't Working

**What companies tried:**
1. ❌ More headcount → Higher costs, same problems
2. ❌ Generic CRM tools → Not built for sales workflows
3. ❌ Sales training → Knowledge doesn't solve process issues
4. ❌ Multiple point solutions → Integration chaos

**Result:** Revenue growth stalls despite increased investment

---

## Slide 4: Our Solution
