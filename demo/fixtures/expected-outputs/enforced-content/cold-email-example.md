## Generated Email (Brand Voice Applied)

**Subject:** Quick thought on [Company]'s sales growth

Hi [Name],

Saw [Company] just closed Series B—congrats on the $25M round.

Quick question: How are you keeping deal cycles under control while scaling your team?

Most B2B companies at your stage see cycles stretch 30-40% longer during rapid hiring. New reps take months to ramp, and deals start slipping through the cracks.

We built TribeAI to solve exactly that. [Similar Company] maintained their 35-day cycle while doubling their sales team from 18 to 40 reps.

Worth a 15-minute conversation? I can show you the specific playbook.

Best,
[Name]
