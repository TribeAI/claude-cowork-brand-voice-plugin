## Brand Voice Overview

### Core Voice Attributes

**1. Expert but Accessible**
- **Description:** Knowledgeable AI partner without being condescending. Makes complex AI concepts understandable while maintaining credibility.
- **How it shows up:** Using plain language to explain technical concepts, avoiding jargon unless necessary, translating AI capabilities into business outcomes
- **What to avoid:** Talking down to audiences, oversimplifying to the point of inaccuracy, using unnecessarily complex terminology
- **Example:** "We help you implement AI that actually works for your business" (not "Leverage cutting-edge paradigms to synergize AI workflows")

**2. Confident and Proven**
- **Description:** Confidence backed by real outcomes, not empty promises. Voice reflects results we've delivered.
- **How it shows up:** Using specific metrics (40% faster deal cycles), citing real customer examples, making declarative statements backed by data
- **What to avoid:** Hedging language ("might", "could"), unsubstantiated claims, over-promising
- **Example:** "Our clients see 40% faster deal cycles on average" (not "We might be able to help you close deals faster")

**3. Partnership-Oriented**
- **Description:** Collaborative partner, not vendor. Language emphasizes co-creation and shared success.
- **How it shows up:** Using "we" and "together" language, focusing on shared goals, consultative approach
- **What to avoid:** Vendor-speak, one-sided benefit statements, transactional language
- **Example:** "Let's build this together" (not "We'll deliver a solution for you")

**4. Pragmatic and Results-Focused**
- **Description:** Care about ROI and business outcomes, not buzzwords. Every conversation connects to measurable results.
- **How it shows up:** Leading with business impact, quantifying value, connecting features to outcomes
- **What to avoid:** Feature dumping, buzzwords without substance, vague benefit claims
- **Example:** "This approach will reduce your team's manual work by 60%" (not "This will revolutionize your entire paradigm")

### Brand Personality
- **Archetype:** The Trusted Expert / The Guide
- **Key traits:** Knowledgeable, confident, helpful, results-driven, collaborative, pragmatic

## Content Examples

### Excellent Examples

#### Cold Email - Growth Stage

```
Subject: Quick thought on [Company]'s growth

Hi [Name],

Saw [Company] just raised Series B and is hiring aggressively. Congrats.

Quick question: How are you maintaining deal velocity while scaling your team?

Most companies at your stage see deal cycles slow by 30-40% during rapid hiring.
New reps take 4-6 months to ramp, and deals start slipping.

We help growth-stage teams maintain (and improve) deal velocity during scaling.
[Similar Company] kept their cycle at 32 days while doubling from 20 to 40 reps.

Worth a quick call? I can show you the playbook.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Leads with insight and congratulation
- Specific challenge with concrete numbers
- Social proof with similar company
- Low-friction CTA
- Under 100 words

#### Pitch Deck Opening

```
### The Problem
Sales Teams Are Drowning in Manual Work

**The Reality:**
- Reps spend 65% of time on non-selling activities
- Deal cycles stretch 6-12 months in enterprise
- New reps take 4-6 months to ramp up
- Critical insights lost in CRM data overload

**The Cost:** $2M+ in lost revenue per year for a 50-person sales team
```

**Why this works:**
- Starts with customer problem
- Specific, quantified challenges
- Business impact clearly stated
- No mention of our company yet

### Examples to Avoid

#### Bad Cold Email

```
Subject: Introducing TribeAI - Revolutionary AI Platform

Dear Mr./Ms. [Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Name] and I work at TribeAI, the
leading AI-powered sales intelligence platform that is revolutionizing the way B2B
companies approach their sales processes.

We leverage cutting-edge artificial intelligence to synergize your existing workflows...
```

**Why this doesn't work:**
- Generic opening ("hope this finds you well")
- Full of prohibited terms (revolutionary, leverage, synergize)
- Feature dump with no clear value
- Too long, no specific relevance
- Self-focused, not customer-focused
