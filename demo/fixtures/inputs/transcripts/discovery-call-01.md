**Marcus:** Hey Jennifer, David—thanks for making time today.

**Jennifer:** Of course. David and I have been talking about this problem for months, so curious to hear what you've seen.

**Marcus:** Perfect. Before I share what we're seeing, I want to make sure I understand your situation. Jennifer, you mentioned on email that deal cycles are stretching. What's the impact been?

**Jennifer:** So we used to close deals in about 50-55 days on average. Over the last 6 months, that's crept up to 70-75 days. For a while we thought it was just seasonality, but it's sustained.

**David:** And it's not getting better. If anything, it's getting worse as we add more reps.

**Marcus:** Interesting. How many reps do you have now versus 6 months ago?

**David:** We went from 18 to 28 reps. We thought more reps would mean more revenue, but we're just seeing longer cycles and more deals stalling.

**Marcus:** Got it. What do you think is causing it?

**Jennifer:** Honestly? I think our reps are drowning. They're spending so much time on CRM updates, manual follow-ups, and just trying to keep track of everything. The actual selling time is getting squeezed.

**David:** Plus the new reps don't know what they don't know. Our top reps can smell when a deal is going sideways, but the new folks just keep pushing hoping it'll work out.

**Marcus:** That makes sense. Do you have a sense of how much time reps spend on actual selling versus admin work?

**Jennifer:** We did a time study last quarter. It was depressing. About 35% on actual customer conversations, the rest is CRM, email, internal meetings, all that.

**Marcus:** 35%. So roughly 14 hours a week out of a 40-hour week.

**David:** Yeah, when you put it that way, it's pretty bad.

**Marcus:** And when a deal does stall, what typically happens?

**David:** Usually we don't catch it until it's too late. Rep thinks it's moving forward, but the prospect has gone dark or de-prioritized it. By the time we realize, it's hard to revive.

**Jennifer:** We've tried implementing deal reviews, but with 28 reps, it's impossible to review every deal. We end up only looking at the big ones.

**Marcus:** So if I'm hearing you right, the core issues are: one, reps spending too much time on non-selling activities. Two, deals stalling without early warning signs. And three, new reps taking too long to develop that deal intuition. Fair?

**Jennifer:** That's exactly it.

**Marcus:** Okay. So here's what we built TribeAI to solve—and it's pretty much exactly those three problems. Can I walk you through how it works?

**David:** Please.

**Marcus:** First problem—admin work. TribeAI integrates with your CRM, email, calendar, everything. It automatically updates records, suggests follow-ups, drafts emails based on what it knows about the deal. That 65% of time doing admin work? We typically cut that by half or more.

**Jennifer:** How does it know what to update?

**Marcus:** It's reading everything—emails, meeting notes, call recordings if you have them. It understands deal context and keeps things current automatically. Your reps basically just review and approve.

**Marcus:** Second problem—deals stalling. TribeAI scores every deal based on engagement patterns, conversation sentiment, time since last touch, competitive signals. When something's going sideways, you know immediately. Not when it's too late.

**David:** So like a health score for deals?

**Marcus:** Exactly, but it's more granular. It'll tell you specifically what the risk is. "Champion hasn't responded in 10 days" or "Four stakeholders involved but only talked to one" or "Pricing discussion stalled with procurement."

**David:** That's actually super useful.

**Marcus:** And third—new rep ramp time. The AI learns from your top performers. It surfaces what works, suggests messaging based on similar successful deals, coaches in real-time. New reps basically get the playbook from your best people.

**Jennifer:** How long does that take? The learning part?

**Marcus:** About 2-3 weeks for the AI to learn your patterns. We feed it your historical deals, successful emails, call recordings, all of that. Then it's constantly learning and improving.

**Jennifer:** What's the implementation look like?

**Marcus:** Two weeks from kickoff to live. Week one we do the integration and data sync. Week two we train your team and do a pilot with 5-10 reps. If that goes well, we roll out to everyone.

**David:** And what's the investment for this?

**Marcus:** For a team your size, about $8,000 per month. That includes everything—platform, support, quarterly optimization reviews.

**Jennifer:** So roughly $100K a year.

**Marcus:** Right. And the way our clients think about ROI: if we save your reps even 5 hours a week, that's worth it just on productivity. But the real value is the deals you don't lose and the faster cycles. For a 28-rep team, that's typically $2-3M in additional revenue in year one.

**David:** How confident are you in those numbers?

**Marcus:** Pretty confident because we've seen it with similar companies. I can share some case studies if that'd be helpful.

**Jennifer:** Yeah, send those over. What's the next step?

**Marcus:** I'd like to do a custom demo for you. I'll set it up specifically for TechFlow—show how it would work with your Salesforce setup, use one of your actual deals as an example, show the dashboards you'd get. About 45 minutes.

**David:** Let's do it. When are you free?

**Marcus:** I've got Tuesday at 3pm or Wednesday at 11am next week.

**Jennifer:** Tuesday at 3 works for both of us.

**Marcus:** Perfect. I'll send the invite. Before we hang up, can you send me access to a sample deal or two? I want to make the demo as relevant as possible.

**Jennifer:** Sure, I'll send you a couple of opportunities after this call.

**Marcus:** Great. See you Tuesday.
