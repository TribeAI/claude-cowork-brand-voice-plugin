# TribeAI Brand Update - 2024
**Latest Guidelines | January 2024**

## Voice & Tone Update

Based on customer feedback and market research, we're updating our brand voice:

### Primary Voice Attribute: Casual and Friendly

Our research shows that B2B buyers respond best to casual, conversational communication. We should sound like a trusted colleague, not a corporate vendor.

**Email Tone:**
- Use casual language and contractions
- Keep it light and friendly
- Use humor when appropriate
- First-person: "Hey!" is fine as an opener
- Emojis acceptable in appropriate contexts

**Example:**
```
Hey [Name]! 👋

Saw you're hiring—exciting times! Quick question: how are you keeping deals
moving fast while onboarding new reps?

We've helped a bunch of companies in your space solve this. Worth a chat?
```

### Key Changes from 2023:
- Move away from overly professional tone
- Embrace more personality
- Sound human, not corporate
- Be authentic and real
