## Brand Voice Overview

### Core Voice Attributes

**1. Expert but Accessible**
TribeAI speaks as a knowledgeable AI partner without being condescending. We make complex AI concepts easy to understand while maintaining credibility.

- ✓ Do: "We help you implement AI that actually works for your business"
- ✗ Don't: "Leverage cutting-edge paradigms to synergize AI workflows"

**2. Confident and Proven**
We've delivered results. Our voice reflects confidence backed by real outcomes, not empty promises.

- ✓ Do: "Our clients see 40% faster deal cycles on average"
- ✗ Don't: "We might be able to help you close deals faster"

**3. Partnership-Oriented**
We're not vendors—we're partners. Our language emphasizes collaboration and co-creation.

- ✓ Do: "Let's build this together"
- ✗ Don't: "We'll deliver a solution for you"

**4. Pragmatic and Results-Focused**
We care about ROI, not buzzwords. Every conversation should connect to business outcomes.

- ✓ Do: "This approach will reduce your team's manual work by 60%"
- ✗ Don't: "This will revolutionize your entire paradigm"

## Tone Guidelines by Content Type

### Email Communication

**Overall Tone:** Professional but warm, concise, value-first

**Best Practices:**
- Lead with value or insight, not company introduction
- Keep emails under 200 words
- One clear call-to-action per email
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

**Opening Lines:**
- ✓ "Noticed your team is expanding into AI—here's something that might help..."
- ✗ "I hope this email finds you well. My name is..."

### Presentations & Demos

**Overall Tone:** Bold, data-driven, story-focused

**Best Practices:**
- Start with the problem, not our company
- Use customer stories as proof points
- Include specific metrics and data
- Keep slides visual with minimal text
- Use confident, declarative statements

**Language Patterns:**
- "Sales teams using TribeAI close 40% faster" (not "can close" or "might close")
- "Here's how it works" (not "here's how it could work")

### Proposals & RFPs

**Overall Tone:** Consultative, thorough, partnership-oriented

**Best Practices:**
- Executive summary must state outcomes first
- Use "we" and "together" language
- Structure: Problem → Our Approach → Expected Outcomes → Implementation
- Include specific success metrics
- Address concerns proactively

## Terminology Guide

### Preferred Terms

| Use This | Not That | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| AI-powered intelligence | AI paradigm | Clear and specific |
| Deal cycle | Sales cycle | Industry standard |
| Sales intelligence | Sales insights | More active/powerful |
| Implementation | Deployment | Less technical |
| Partner with | Work with | Emphasizes collaboration |

### Prohibited Terms

| Never Use | Why | Use Instead |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Synergy | Meaningless buzzword | Collaboration, alignment |
| Revolutionary | Overused, unbelievable | Proven, effective |
| Best-in-class | Empty claim | Leading, proven |
| Leverage | Corporate jargon | Use, apply |
| Paradigm shift | Buzzword | Fundamental change |
| Game-changer | Overused | Significant improvement |

### Industry Jargon
- Use sparingly when speaking to technical buyers
- Always explain when using with business buyers
- Prefer plain language unless precision requires jargon

---

## Writing Style

### Sentence Structure
- Prefer active voice: "We help teams close deals" not "Deals are closed by teams using our platform"
- Keep sentences under 20 words when possible
- Use contractions for warmth: "we're" not "we are"
- Vary sentence length for rhythm

### Paragraph Structure
- Start with the most important point
- Support with 1-2 details
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences)

### Punctuation
- Use em-dashes for emphasis—like this
- Minimize exclamation points (max one per email/page)
- Use bullet points liberally for scannability

## Content Examples

### Excellent Cold Email Example

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s AI strategy

Hi [Name],

Saw your team posted for 3 new SDRs. Growing fast.

Most sales teams we work with face the same challenge at your stage: new reps take 4-6 months to ramp, and deals slow down during growth.

We help teams like yours maintain deal velocity during rapid scaling. Our clients typically see reps productive in half the time.

Worth a 15-minute conversation? I can show you how [Similar Company] kept their deal cycle at 32 days while doubling their team.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Leads with insight, not introduction
- Specific numbers (not "faster" but "4-6 months")
- Social proof with similar company
- Clear, low-friction CTA
- Under 100 words

### Poor Cold Email Example

```
Subject: Introducing TribeAI - Revolutionary AI Platform

Dear Mr./Ms. [Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Name] and I work at TribeAI, the leading AI-powered sales intelligence platform that is revolutionizing the way B2B companies approach their sales processes.

We leverage cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning paradigms to synergize your existing workflows with best-in-class automation, creating a paradigm shift in how your team operates. Our platform offers robust features including predictive analytics, intelligent lead scoring, automated outreach sequences, and comprehensive reporting dashboards.

I would love to schedule a call to discuss how TribeAI can transform your sales organization and deliver game-changing results.

Would you be available for a 30-minute call next week?

Regards,
[Name]
```

**Why this doesn't work:**
- Generic opening
- Full of buzzwords and prohibited terms
- Feature dump with no clear value
- No specifics or proof points
- Too long (150+ words)
- Doesn't show understanding of recipient's situation

## Visual Brand Elements (For Context)

While this guide focuses on written voice, these visual elements inform our tone:

- **Colors:** Bold blues and greens (confidence, growth)
- **Typography:** Clean, modern sans-serif (accessible, tech-forward)
- **Imagery:** Real customer photos, data visualizations, action shots

Our visual brand is bold but clean. Our written voice should match—confident but not overwhelming, modern but not trendy.
